# Apollo-11

11 stage plan to know end-to-end of k8s/cloudnative ecosystem

```
First do it
Then do it right
Then do it better
```

--------------------------------
Stage 1: Basics + Local setup [ 1 week ]
--------------------------------

Go Lang basics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpKysZwllVw&t=488s

Kubernetes basics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X48VuDVv0do&t=6088s
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/

Install minikube & understand the basics:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/hello-minikube/

Install and Get overview of kubectl
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/

Create namespace "application"
Create everything using configuration yaml

Goal> good enough knowledge of k8s and golang to get started

--------------------------------
Stage 2: Rest api + backend in local k8s cluster [ 2 weeks ]
--------------------------------

Create a simple go rest API
Build docker image with it
Figure how to link local image repo in minikube 

Create a deployment and expose as external service
Should be able to access it from browser as <externalip>.port

Create namespace "nosql"
mongodb deployment
Expose mongodb as internal service
Mongodb credentials stored in secrets.
Then referenced from mongoexpress deployment
(Need to create secrets before you can use them)

Learn peristent volumes and stateful sets and change mongodb to that instead of deployment

Create a config map of non sensitive values if needed
Mongo express deployment
Expose mongodbexpress as external service

Change go code to interact with mongodb
Make the go service interact with mongodb service
Crud operation should work 


Create namespace front end
Add a small front end app to the make calls to go api

Create local image

Create it as deployment and load env variables from a config map
Expose it as external service


Goal> Rest api to interact with mongodb. mongoexpress to interact with mongodb. Frontend to interact with API

--------------------------------
Stage 3: Routing using ingress controller [ 1 week ]
--------------------------------

Create ingress rules for sample url ---> gobuydoge.com
/Frontend will take to frontend external service
/Backend will take to backeelnd external service


Create ingress controller to control all the routes
On local machine add entry for gobuydoge.com to the ingress controller ip

Gobuydoge.com/frontend should show frontend
Gobuydoge.com/backend should show backend


Extra:
	- Have a look at various other ingress controllers: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/191WWNpjJ2za6-nbG4ZoUMXMpUK8KlCIosvQB0f-oq3k/htmlview?pru=AAABdXUHlbs*g6XkyoZXhanlhRazst77Xw
	- Try Traefik v2 ingress controller


--------------------------------
Stage 4: Move on from Minikube/Docker
--------------------------------

Move to creating two virtual machines(vagrant)
One will be master
One will be worker


Learn kubernetes the hard way
Create control node components on master node
Install any other container runtime other than docker
Run the same workload that was run on minikube

Run the above setup in either of a cloud k8s platform (manually for now):
- EKS
- AKS
- GKE
- Linode


Extra: 
- Use buildah to build container images instead of 
- Try different local k8s platforms: k3s,kind,microk8s.
- Aws eks infra building with CDK

--------------------------------
Stage 5: Helm packaging
--------------------------------


- helm packages building


--------------------------------
Stage 6: Service Mesh
--------------------------------
- Service mesh ISTIO

A service mesh, like the open source project Istio, is a way to control how different parts of an application share data with one another. Unlike other systems for managing this communication, a service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer built right into an app. This visible infrastructure layer can document how well (or not) different parts of an app interact, so it becomes easier to optimize communication and avoid downtime as an app grows.

--------------------------------
Stage 7: Monitoring + Tracing
--------------------------------

- K8s monitoring
	- EFK Logging
	- lens
	- prometheus
	- Tracing using opentelementry


--------------------------------
Stage 8: Deployment/Gitops
--------------------------------

- K8s Deployment strategy
	- CICD using github actions
	- DevSecops
	- TestOps
	- k8s misconfiguration from reaching production- datree 

- Various deployment patterns in K8s
- gitops with flux v2

--------------------------------
Stage 8: Event driven architecture
--------------------------------

- Introduce a event bus or stream eg. Apache FLink and operate using same


--------------------------------
Stage 9: Testing + Chaos Engineering + Backup and Restore
-------------------------------- 

- DevSecOps
- inject failure into your Kubernetes clusters

--------------------------------
Stage 10: Security and Compliance
--------------------------------

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/

- Secure the cluster based on the 4Câ€™s of cloud native security
- kubehunter
- Gatekeeper

- Enforce good practices using datree

--------------------------------
Stage 11: Go deeper
--------------------------------

- Admission controllers/webhooks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mNYSn2KMZk
- Kubernetes Operator
